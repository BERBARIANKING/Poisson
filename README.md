# Poisson
A Poisson based simulation and visualization collection of programs using python

This program simulates and visualizes a Poisson distribution based on user-defined parameters. The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.

## Example

In this program we are given a series of questions based on mean of the distribution and the range 

For this example we are able to provide a mean of 7 with a range of 0 to 17

The output is provided in the figure below:
