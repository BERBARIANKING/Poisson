# Poisson
A [Poisson](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/poisson-distribution#:~:text=The%20PMF%20of%20the%20Poisson,distribution%20is%20the%20sample%20mean.) based simulation and visualization collection of programs using python


This program simulates and visualizes a Poisson distribution based on user-defined parameters. The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.


The following are the key criteria that the random variable follows the Poisson distribution:

- Individual events occur at random and independently in a given interval. This can be an interval of time or space.

- The mean number of occurrences of events in an interval (time or space) is finite and known. The mean number of occurrences is represented using [latex]\lambda[/latex]


The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:

## Example

In this program we are given a series of questions based on mean of the distribution and the range 

For this example we are able to provide a mean of 7 with a range of 0 to 17


The output is provided in the figure below:
